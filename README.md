# Python-Hurricane-Analysis
Codecademy Project: Hurricane Analysis

Meetup page here: https://community.codecademy.com/events/details/codecademy-seoul-presents-python-portfolio-projects-hurricanes-35-minutes/


Codecademy's project, Hurricane Analysis, is basically a bit of data on hurricanes plus some open ended questions and it can be completed on- or off-platform. Having recently worked on it, I found that there were a whole bunch of different ways of going about it. In this meet-up, I will be presenting some of mine. If you have recently completed this project, or are planning to, or are looking to apply some of your skills off-platform but don't know where to start, join the meet-up and let's share solutions!
